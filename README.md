# AI

Attempt to simulate neural activity for vision.

## Configs

* Max and min charges are 10, -10.  (should transmitters have great potential?)
* standard action threshold is 5
* Decay rate is 0 if < 10ms, 1/2 if < 20ms, 1/4 if < 30, 0 otherwise

## TODO

* do more testing on center surround behaviours by adding names, and having a standard output.
